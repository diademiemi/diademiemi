Hi! Thanks for checking out my GitHub Sponsors! I'm a Linux engineer from the Netherlands with hobbyist software development aspirations. I like helping and teaching others, and try to open source as much as I can to provide value to other people. By sponsoring me you can help me afford hosting costs for my public sites, supplies, hardware and software to make more! 

What I do most is make Ansible content, write other Infrastructure as Code solutions and generally deploy and orchestrate Linux hosts. On the side, I also have a few websites, make Minecraft plugins and some hardware projects. I also greatly enjoy pushing software to its limits or otherwise doing ridiculous stuff with software that it was never intended to be used for, such as writing an HTTP server in Ansible or rendering videos in Ansible! 

I've split my projects into a few categories, and I'll highlight and explain the most significant ones below!

### Certifications
Among other certifications, I currently have *Red Hat Certified Architect*, *Red Hat Certified Specialist in Developing Automation with Ansible Automation Platform*, *Red Hat Certified Specialist in Deployment and Systems Management*, *SUSE Certified Administrator in Rancher* and *SUSE Certified Deployment Specialist in Rancher Manager*

You can check out the full list of my certifications, along with exam preparation material I made and uploaded in my [Certifications repository](https://github.com/diademiemi/certifications)! I hope these can help others study for these exams, or just learn the software!
###### All exam preparation materials are made before I took the exam, so these are allowed. I merely confirmed their accuracy after taking the exam

### Ansible projects
I have an active easy overview of all my Ansible content on my website, where you can view a table along with maintenance status of all my Ansible content: [diademiemi.me/projects/ansible](https://diademiemi.me/projects/ansible)

Alternatively, you can search in [my repositories](https://github.com/diademiemi?tab=repositories&q=ansible) for a list of my Ansible code!

The standouts are [my Syncthing Role](https://github.com/diademiemi/ansible_role_syncthing) and [my Collection for various JetBrains IDEs](https://github.com/diademiemi/ansible_collection_diademiemi.jetbrains)

I also maintain templates for [Ansible Roles](https://github.com/diademiemi/ansible_role_template) and [Ansible Collections](https://github.com/diademiemi/ansible_collection_diademiemi.template) which make it easy to kickstart making new Ansible content, and it automatically configures a resilient and production-grade cross-platform coding style, Molecule tests on various Linux distributions and automatic publishing to Ansible Galaxy. The templates are used in production environments spanning many different Linux distributions to great success at my workplace, as these were developed with the intent of both privately for work and publicly for my GitHub

### Infrastructure projects
- [Homelab (v3)](https://github.com/diademiemi/homelab) : This is my homelab project. It is split across a NAS at home and a dedicated server rented at Hetzner. These run the applications I self-host along with a few public websites. It's built on Kubernetes with Rancher, Fleet, ArgoCD, Terraform and Ansible connecting it together! The README explains what every files purpose is, so I hope this can encourage others to learn Infrastructure as Code and DevOps practices!
- [Terraform standard environment](https://github.com/diademiemi/terraform_standard_environment) : This is a repository of standard structured Terraform code I frequently include as a submodule in other projects. The goal of this code is to be used as-is, and only require variables to change its functionality. This has helped me save a lot of time in my testing environments
- [Testing environments](https://github.com/diademiemi/test_envs) : This is a collection of standard testing environments I use for quick proof of concepts and comparing to real environments. This includes code to, among other things, deploy at production-grade a full RKE2 cluster, a Rancher platform with upstream and separate downstream clusters or a bootstrapping environment with AWX and Foreman working in tandem to initialise new machines. This is all deployed using Terraform with Ansible being used to glue standardised Terraform code together, so that you can pick independently of each other the hosting provider for the machines (current available options include DigitalOcean, Hetzner and Libvirt) and where the DNS records are deployed (current available options include DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, a VyOS DNS server and local /etc/hosts), this makes it a breeze to quickly deploy to either use as demonstration or quick tests, and has saved me a lot of time and work

### Web projects
- [tonetag.is](https://github.com/tonetag/tonetag) : A website and API to look up definitions of tone indicators, often called tone tags. Tone tags are often used to convey tone and intent in purely text-based communication, this is popular among the neurodivergent community to communicate clearly. The site also embeds into chat applications, so you can look an indicator up without needing to leave your chat program. You can check out the site at [tonetag.is](https://tonetag.is), it is hosted on my dedicated server in Kubernetes and deployed via ArgoCD. You can check the [deployment repository](https://github.com/tonetag/deployment) to learn how it's deployed into an existing Kubernetes cluster, and my previously linked homelab as how said Kubernetes cluster is deployed and orchestrated. It is written in Kotlin using Red Hat Quarkus
- [Webring API](https://github.com/diademiemi/webring-api) : A Kotlin-based Red Hat Quarkus API and web page which was used to help maintain a webring. The program automatically connects the links between websites on the webring, and automatically compensates for unreachable websites or those that result in a dead end. This uses a PostgreSQL database, the repository also contains unit and integration tests ran in CI, which spin up a mock database for tests, and eventually build for multiple architectures and create container images which are pushed. This means that this repository could serve as a good example for deployment pipelines with Quarkus applications, hence its CC0 license.
- [diademiemi.me](https://github.com/diademiemi/diademiemi.me) : My personal website, it has a projects page, Ansible content tracker, blog and just general information about me! It is made in Jekyll using a custom theme and deployed on GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. You can visit it at [diademiemi.me](https://diademiemi.me)

### Minecraft plugins
- [Adventageous](https://github.com/diademiemi/Adventageous) : A daily rewards / advent calendar plugin with an easy to use GUI menu to claim rewards and have a fun visual advent calendar. This plugin incentivises playing daily and engagement around rewards, especially around specifically configured events! The GUI is also used for admins, so there's no need to mess around in configuration files, everything is done in-game through simple menus. 
- [InvUILib](https://github.com/diademiemi/InvUILib) : A standalone implementation of the UI used in Adventageous, with APIs that can be used to make simple and secure UIs in your own plugins, with optional Bedrock mobile considerations through Geyser. Available on Maven Central as [me.diademiemi.invuilib](https://mavenlibs.com/maven/dependency/me.diademiemi/invuilib). Has been used with over 50 players all in a complicated interactive menu at the same time on a public server, and there was no performance issue, bleed-over between player menus or exploits which were all prevented due to the plugins safe nature of handling menus, where no materials actually exists and are purely presented through client communication and every menu is strictly tied to a player and their given permission nodes
- [Embellish](https://github.com/diademiemi/Embellish) : A simple to use nickname colour helper to assist players in making colourful and unique name formats. The plugin can help apply solid colours, patterns and gradients to text, along with presets that can be configured by admins, for example to add pride flags. After applying colours to a text, it has a simple clickable chat component button to apply the nickname if it conforms to nickname standards. The plugin is also frequently used to make pretty text on signs and other places where Minecraft uses colour codes
- [Lineation](https://github.com/diademiemi/Lineation) : A minigame event management tool which assists in tracking players in a competitive race. The plugin manages the starting line to allow players to fairly start the minigame at the same time. The plugin then checks for events and positions to determine the first players to cross the designated finish line to announce winners of the contest. The minigames can also feature checkpoints which are required to be hit in order for the finish line to be counted, this also allows for multiple laps of the same raceway, you can also set out of bounds areas which will return you to the starting position or latest checkpoint when hit. The plugin stores latest winners so these can be queried later, and has a feature to limit how many times a player can get in the leaderboard of a minigame, so that if prizes are awarded based on positions, the same skilled players won't exclusively get all the prizes
- [Whereis](https://github.com/diademiemi/Bukkit-Whereis) : A simple admin tool to display information about a specific command, such as which plugin provides a given command, whether it's an alias of anything else and for multi-command aliases the sequence of commands that it is linked to

### Hardware projects & 3D printing
- [Panoply](https://github.com/diademiemi/Panoply) : A Python program to display information on a matrix display connected to a Raspberry Pi. It can retrieve data from Home Assistant and other sources to be used as a dashboard
- [3D printed infinity cube fidget toy](https://www.printables.com/model/652108-infinity-cube-print-in-place) : This is a print-in-place infinity cube. This model was made after I was not satisfied with how other infinity cubes on Printables take a long time to feel smooth. I made custom supports that are built into the model which allow these to easily bridge. Made in OpenSCAD, you can view this and other fidget toys in my [GitHub Fidget Toys repository](https://github.com/diademiemi/openscad_fidget_toys), this also includes automated CI, builds, previews and asset uploads, so this could be a good example!
- [K1 Max configs](https://github.com/diademiemi/3d_printer_configs_k1_max) : My Klipper and slicer configurations for my rooted K1 Max
- [Ender 3 configs](https://github.com/diademiemi/3d_printer_configs_ender3) : My Klipper and slicer configurations for my Klipperized original model Ender 3, along with modifications and repairs I've made to it

### Humor or proof of concept projects
- [Ansible HTTP Server](https://github.com/diademiemi/ansible-http-server) : A ridiculous proof of concept using new Event Driven Ansible features to communicate over TCP sockets and have *Ansible directly* function as a "usable" web server. You're reading that right, using Ansible as the web server, not just installing an existing one
- [Ansible Advent of Code 2023](https://github.com/diademiemi/ansible_advent_of_code_2023) : The first week of AoC 2023, but done in Ansible. Ansible was not meant to do large calculations, and some of these tasks can take upwards of **7 hours**. Check out my blog posts about why this is funny: ["The Start"](https://diademiemi.me/blog/2023/12/04/AoC2023-Ansbible-Start/) and ["The Oops"](https://diademiemi.me/blog/2023/12/29/AoC2023-Ansbible-Oops/)
- [Bad Apple, but it's in Ansible](https://github.com/diademiemi/ansible_collection_diademiemi.bad_apple) : My take on the popular "Bad Apple, but..." trend, to recreate the video in many mediums. I use Ansible to prepare an environment, convert the frames to ASCII and display them in real-time through Ansible debug modules. This is in a collection, so it theoretically could be actually used to view any video file in Ansible runs, although the pre-processing time is significant. [Watch the video here!](https://youtu.be/Wb9iwFk3atA)
- [websitesvoorgratis.nl](https://github.com/diademiemi/websitesvoorgratis.nl) : A popular Dutch latenight show, "De Avondshow met Arjen Lubach" had a sketch in which they showed and read aloud a domain name, which was supposed to be a website. They registered the wrong domain, leaving the one used in the sketch available. To prevent a malicious actor from controlling the site and using it to spread malware or inappropriate content. I quickly bodged together a simple goof site, but it is made in Jekyll and could be used as a nice example of how to incorporate custom HTML and CSS into Jekyll, along with inline Markdown and HTML features specific to Jekyll
- [AprilFools2024](https://github.com/Queercraft/AprilFools2024) : A plugin making use of my InvUILib for players on the Queercraft Minecraft server on April Fools 2024. This plugin was intended to be frustrating in nature, as it would mimic annoying websites, such as overly complicated required CAPTCHAS, popup ads and ridiculous cookies, privacy policies and user agreements. It was a resounding success and led to many laughs, annoyances and people trying to discover every last joke hidden in the plugin. It made for an enjoyable day and a memorable prank
